# Pi-Hole

This is meant as a way to aggregate multiple blocklists into one. In no way am I the original creator of these lists and nor do I claim to be, I have only combined ones I felt have been useful and/or ones that I personally use. All lists (or where they can be found) will be linked below.

## Installation
1. Logon to the Pi-Hole WebUI
2. Navigate to Settings>Blocklist
3. Scroll down and copy the Lists from below that you would like to use:


- [List 1:]() Contains domains from WaLLy3K over at https://firebog.net. All of these Domains are considered least likely to interfere with browsing.
- [List 2:]() Contains domains from WaLLy3K over at https://firebog.net. These domains are likely to block multiple useful sites (e.g: Pi-hole updates, Amazon, Netflix). Please note that this can interfere with many normal, non-ad related features on devices. (For advance users)
