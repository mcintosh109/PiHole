# Pi-Hole

This is meant as a way to aggregate multiple blocklists into one. In no way am I the original creator of these lists and nor do I claim to be, I have only combined ones I felt have been useful and/or ones that I personally use. All lists (or where they can be found) will be linked below. Please make sure to utilize the provided white-list regardless of if you use the Extended Primary Blocklist.

## Installation
1. Log on to the Pi-Hole WebUI
2. Navigate to Settings>Blocklist
3. Scroll down and copy the Lists from below that you would like to use:

```
- [List 1:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicholasb2101/PiHole/master/Primary%20Blocklist.txt?token=AG7JK7OH6PDYPYWDVJDJTWK5CAU36) Contains domains from WaLLy3K over at https://firebog.net. All of these Domains are considered least likely to interfere with browsing.
- [List 2:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicholasb2101/PiHole/master/Extended%20Primary%20Blocklist.txt?token=AG7JK7O4QOCSM5TLQVBWUMS5CAU7G) Contains domains from WaLLy3K over at https://firebog.net. These domains are likely to block multiple useful sites (e.g: Pi-hole updates, Amazon, Netflix). Please note that this can interfere with many normal, non-ad related features on devices. (For advance users)
